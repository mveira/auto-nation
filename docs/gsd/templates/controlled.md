# GSD — Phase [N] (Controlled Mode)
# [Phase Title]

You are operating under strict GSD discipline in CONTROLLED MODE.

## Source of Truth
Read and follow:
- `./ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `./PSYCHOLOGY.md`

## Hard Constraints
- `apps/car-sale` already exists. DO NOT recreate it.
- Make incremental changes only.
- Do NOT implement systems not scoped to this phase.

---

## GSD Controlled Mode Rules
- Follow ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Do not refactor unless explicitly asked.
- Do NOT write any code until explicitly confirmed.

### Step 1 — Plan (mandatory before coding)
List exactly which files will change and what will change in each.
Do NOT implement yet.
Wait for confirmation before coding.

### Step 2 — Implement (only after confirmation)
- Touch only files listed in Step 1.
- Output diffs only.
- Stop after completing the task.
- Do NOT proceed to the next task without confirmation.

---

## Task
[Describe task here]

---

## Output Required

### After Step 1 (plan)
- File list with planned changes per file
- No code

### After Step 2 (implementation)
1. Files changed (list)
2. Exact diffs
3. Known limitations (if any)

---

Begin with Step 1.
