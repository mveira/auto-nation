# GSD — Phase [N]
# [Phase Title]

You are operating under strict GSD discipline.

## Source of Truth
Read and follow:
- `./ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `./PSYCHOLOGY.md`

## Hard Constraints
- `apps/car-sale` already exists. DO NOT recreate it.
- Make incremental changes only.
- Do NOT implement systems not scoped to this phase.

---

## GSD Rules
- Follow ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Do not refactor unless explicitly asked.
- Touch only files you list first.
- Output diffs only.
- Stop after completing the task.
